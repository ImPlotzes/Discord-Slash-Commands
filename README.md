# Plotzes Commands
Plotzes Commands is a Discord application providing [application commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands "application commands"). This project is bundled with Webpack and hosted on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ "Cloudflare Workers").

## How to use
You can use these commands when you join [my Discord server](https://www.plotzes.ml/discord "my Discord server"). You can also add these application commands to your own server by using the `/invite` command (or clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=865321519605612554&scope=applications.commands "here")).

Once you're in a server with the application commands you can use them by typing `/` and then choosing one of the suggested commands. You can find all commands by scrolling throught the suggested commands in Discord or [here](https://github.com/ImPlotzes/Discord-Slash-Commands/tree/main/commands "here").
